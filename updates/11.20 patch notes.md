This is a smaller patch, so there isn't much to cover.
* Smite Healing Nerf: The smite nerfs will definitely hurt junglers that already struggle with their clear, this also affects dueling in the early game.
* Imperial Mandate Buff: I doubt the buffs will be enough to bring Mandate back into the meta. 
* Taliyah Nerfs: I doubt these changes will bring Taliyah out of S tier. She's more of a gank jungler, so this will really only hurt her early clear slightly. 
* Amumu Nerfs: The damage nerfs don't really do much. However, the mana nerfs are massive. He can Q twice, so that's 140 mana. So it'll punish players when they don't land the Q.
* Singed Nerfs: Singed has been strong for awhile now, especially when going full AP. So these are decent nerfs to his mid and late game. 
* Jarvan IV Nerfs: I think Jarvan has came back into the meta after being absent for awhile. He is very strong in dueling and in his ganking. The passive nerfs won't do much, he'll still be strong. 
* Irelia Nerfs: Same thing with Jarvan here, I doubt the passive nerfs are enough. I think it's a good start though. She'll still win duels in the side lane against much champs.
* Shen Nerfs: I'm surprised about this Shen nerf, I haven't been seeing him a lot in soloq or pro play. This nerf probably won't affect him much. 
* Darius Buffs: With the stridebreaker changes a few patch back, Darius can't stick to his targets as well, so the W buff will help with that. He maxes W last too, so this is a strong buff.
* Hecarim Buffs: The 4 seconds off his W will be big. He can use it more often in fights and in his clear. He maxes W last too, so its a buff for the whole game. 
* Udyr Buffs: Udyr's cone damage buff won't be enough to bring him back into the meta. It's more a placebo buff.
