Hi, my name is Tony. I'm currently a CS major at University of Washington. I'm originally from Everett and enjoy playing video games. 
On my site you'll see that I post a lot about League of Legends updates, or my thoughts on the new champions. 
I have been playing the game for many years and enjoy it a lot.
